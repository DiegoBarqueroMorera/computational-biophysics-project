        <p>
          In the first part of this section we present a brief introduction on water models and in particular on the <code>TIP3P</code> model, that was employed in our simulation. Then, we introduce a method for analyzing the water distribution around the protein. Finally we estimate the accessible surface area with the GROMACS tool SASA.
        </p>

        <h2>Water Model</h2>
          <p>
            Modelling water is a challenging task since its microscopic structure at the liquid state it is not known yet and many different models are available. The choice of the water model is determined by
            <ul>
              <li>The size of the system.</li>
              <li>The simulation period.</li>
              <li>The physical properties that have to be simulated with the most accuracy.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            The most suitable model for our system was the <code>TIP3P</code>, This water model is widely used because it is not too computationally demanding. Even to simulate a simple protein in water, a large number of water molecule is required, and their positions and velocity have to be updated at every time step. It is then necessary to have a quite simple water model. More complex models are available, but it is possible to employ them only on small systems, with less than $1000$ water molecules, and for short simulation periods $(\simeq1ps)$. These are not the length and time scales of biophysical systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            This model, as many other frequently used, ignores the proton hopping from one molecule to another, which favours the cluster formation. It describes the water as a planar molecule, with three interaction sites, an Oxygen atom and two Hydrogens. The atoms interact due to the Coulomb interaction and are modeled as point like particles. The long range electrostatic interaction is truncated after a cutoff distance. The Oxygen atom also interacts with other molecules by means of the Lennard-Jones interaction. <a href="https://water.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_structure_science.html">Source</a>.
          </p>


        <h2>Water Average Local Densities (WALD)</h2>
          <p>
            After the observations regarding the "active site obstruction" event in the previous sections, we are interested in knowing if the accesibility of the active site by its ligand is indeed affected or not. An intuitive approach is to observe how accesible is the active site to water molecules. Water molecules visits this and other cavities during the trajectory, unless they get obstructed in some way. Therefore, we can keep track of the positions of water molecules through the trajectory, and in this way measure a sort of local density which can hint on the accesibility of water to different spaces of the protein.
          </p>
          <p>
            We introduce a methodology based in this idea, called <b>Water Average Local Densities</b>. It is divided in three main parts: selection of frames of interest, calculation of local densities, and visualization of results. The script <code>src_analysis/wad.py</code> is to be used for executing the different steps of the pipeline. We follow this workflow for <code>mt2_rep0</code>.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 0: Frames Selection</h3>
            <p>
              The WALD method averages over a set of frames to obtain the average local densities. The final result is displayed as an overlay of a particular frame of interest that has to be chosen beforehand. Therefore, it is sensitive to select a set of frames that are structurally similar to the reference, in order to have good results. We choose RMSD as a measure of similarity, and choose all the frames of the simulation under a given treshold RMSD value against the reference frame.
            </p>

            <p>
              To facilitate this procedure, we provide an adapted version of interactive RMSD plot, where both reference frame and treshold values can be modulated, and then saved in <code>data_analysis/wald/mt2_rep0-info.json</code>. This file contains different values and parameters required by the methodology and allows to "communicate" easily between different steps without having to restart the workflow. This step can be executed by using the command <code>wad.py -0</code>.
            </p>

              <figcaption class="text-center">Interactive RMSD. The reference frame and maximum RMSD treshold value can be modulated to manually cluster points that will be the set of frames for the WALD methodology.</figcaption>
            </figure>

          <h3>Step 1: Local Densities Calculation</h3>
            <p>
              The WALD method is a grid based approach, which means we divide the simulation box in smaller and evenly spaced cubes. A three-dimensional grid is then populated with the experimental density values of these cubes (hence the name <i>local densities</i>). The size of the grid is a relevant parameter, too few or too many points would lead to pointless results. In our implementation, this is controlled by the parameter <code>WAD_DIVISIONS</code> at <code>src_analysis/wad_pipeline/_params.py</code>. We found that <code>WAD_DIVISIONS = 20</code> is a good empirical value for the parameter, which means that WALD grids will have a shape of $20 \times 20 \times 20$ and a size of $8000$.
            </p>
            <p>
              Populating the WALD grid is straightforward. For each grid point, we count how many water molecules go into its respective grid for all the frames of interest, then divide it by the number of frames of interest to obtain the average. This step can be executed by using the command <code>wad.py -2</code>.
            </p>

          <h3>Visualization</h3>
            <p>
              Visualization of the results is trickier, as we would like to represent the three-dimensional grid together with the protein in a non obstructive way. We had to choose between implementing a 3D mesh semi-transparent display method on a molecular visualization tool (such as VMD) or to implement a protein display method on a standard plotting library (such as Matplotlib). We chose the latter to keep the overall implementation ont the same Python workframe. However, some usage of VMD is still required, as will be presented now.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 2: Preparation of meshes with VMD</h4>

            <h4>Step 3: Conversion of meshes</h4>

            <h4>Step 4: Display of results</h4>

        <h2>Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA)</h2>
          <p>
            A quantitative way to investigate the distribution of water molecules around the whole protein consists in using SASA, a GROMACS tool which computes the solvent accessible surface area. The input file consists in all the non solvent atoms, that is the entire protein. Starting from this input the entire surface of the protein is calculated. From the WAD analysis we noticed that some regions of the protein are hydrophilic and some other are hydrophobic.

            <figure>
              <img src="figures/sasa/sfe.png", alt="figures/sasa/sfe.png">
              <figcaption class="text-center">Solvation Free Energy.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            The solvation free energy is calculated according to the interaction between water molecules and the external residues of the protein at a given time. It is highly noisy, probably due to the water molecules moving quickly each frame and sometimes being closer to hydrophilic or hydrophobic segments of the protein. The solvent accessible surface area calculated next is derived from this solvation free energy.

            <figure>
              <img src="figures/sasa/area.png", alt="figures/sasa/area.png">
              <figcaption class="text-center">Surface area accessible by the solvent for each frame.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            Using SASA, the surface of the protein which is accessible by the solvent for each frame was estimated. It seems that the area is increasing until $100000 ps$ and then it oscillates around a constant value. The noise is again significant, which difficults infering whether the data follows any trend.

            <figure>
              <img src="figures/sasa/oa.png", alt="figures/sasa/oa.png">
              <figcaption class="text-center">Average surface area accessible by the solvent for each atom over the trajectory.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            The aforementioned noise is especially significant in this the case. However, we can observe four atoms with an average surface area of above $0.4 nm^2$ (atoms 704, 705, 5383, 5384). All four atoms correspond to terminal oxygens for glutamine groups. This aminoacid is large and very hydrophilic, so it makes sense that they tend to be in the exterior in contact with water.

            <figure>
              <img src="figures/sasa/or.png", alt="figures/sasa/or.png">
              <figcaption class="text-center">Average surface area accessible by the solvent for each residue over the trajectory.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            A similar behaviour can be seen in the area per residue over the trajectory. We observe that there are two residues with an average surface area higher than $2 nm^2$, namely residues $222$ and $154$. These correspond to arginine and tyrosine respectively, which are again large and hydrophilic groups, with the difference that their overall polar area is even higher than glutamine, which explains why these points overcome the glutamine residues observed before.
