        <h2>Water Model</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most intriguing parts of the system under study was the water surrounding the protein. In the first part of this section we present a brief introduction on water models and in particular on the <code>TIP3P</code> model, that was employed in our simulation. The second part is devoted to a simulation of the water distribution around the protein. We observe how water molecules arrange according to the hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of the residues. Finally we estimate the accessible surface with the GROMACS tool SASA.
          </p>

          <p>
            Modelling water is a challenging task since its microscopic structure at the liquid state it is not known yet and many different models are available. The choice of the water model is determined by
            <ul>
              <li>The size of the system.</li>
              <li>The simulation period.</li>
              <li>The physical properties that have to be simulated with the most accuracy.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            The most suitable model for our system was the <code>TIP3P</code>, This water model is widely used because it is not too computationally demanding. Even to simulate a simple protein in water, a large number of water molecule is required, and their positions and velocity have to be updated at every time step. It is then necessary to have a quite simple water model. More complex models are available, but it is possible to employ them only on small systems, with less than $1000$ water molecules, and for short simulation periods $(\simeq1ps)$. These are not the length and time scales of biophysical systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            This model, as many other frequently used, ignores the proton hopping from one molecule to another, which favours the cluster formation. It describes the water as a planar molecule, with three interaction sites, an Oxygen atom and two Hydrogens. The atoms interact due to the Coulomb interaction and are modeled as point like particles. The long range electrostatic interaction is truncated after a cutoff distance. The Oxygen atom also interacts with other molecules by means of the Lennard-Jones interaction.

        <h2>Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA)</h2>
          <p>
            A more quantitative way to investigate the distribution of water molecules around the protein consists in using SASA, a GROMACS tool which computes the solvent accessible surface area. The input file consists in all the non solvent atoms, that is the entire protein. Starting from this input the entire surface of the protein is calculated. From the WAD analysis we noticed that some regions of the protein are hydrophilic and some other are hydrophobic.

            <figure>

              <figcaption class="text-center">Solvation Free Energy.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            The solvation free energy is calculated according to the interaction between water molecules and the external residues of the protein at a given time. It is highly noisy, probably due to the water molecules moving quickly each frame and sometimes being closer to hydrophilic or hydrophobic segments of the protein. The solvent accessible surface area calculated next is derived from this solvation free energy.

            <figure>
              <img src="figures/sasa/area.png", alt="figures/sasa/area.png">
              <figcaption class="text-center">Surface area accessible by the solvent for each frame.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            Using SASA, the surface of the protein which is accessible by the solvent for each frame was estimated. It seems that the area is increasing until $100000 ps$ and then it oscillates around a constant value. The noise is again significant, which difficults infering whether the data follows any trend.

              <figcaption class="text-center">Average surface area accessible by the solvent for each atom over the trajectory.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            The aforementioned noise is especially significant in this the case. However, we can observe four atoms with an average surface area of above $0.4 nm^2$ (atoms 704, 705, 5383, 5384). All four atoms correspond to terminal oxygens for glutamine groups. This aminoacid is large and very hydrophilic, so it makes sense that they tend to be in the exterior in contact with water.

              <figcaption class="text-center">Average surface area accessible by the solvent for each residue over the trajectory.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            A similar behaviour can be seen in the area per residue over the trajectory. We observe that there are two residues with an average surface area higher than $2 nm^2$, namely residues $222$ and $154$. These correspond to arginine and tyrosine respectively, which are again large and hydrophilic groups, with the difference that their overall polar area is even higher than glutamine, which explains why these points overcome the glutamine residues observed before.
