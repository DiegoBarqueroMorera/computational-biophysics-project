        <h2>Water Model</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most intriguing part of the system under study was the water surrounding the protein. In the first part of this section we present a brief introduction on water models and in particular on the $TIP3P$ model, that was employed in our simulation. The second part is devoted to a simulation of the water distribution around the protein. We observe how water molecules arrange according to the hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of the residues. Finally we estimate the accessible surface with the GROMACS tool SASA.
          </p>

          <p>
            Modelling water is a challenging task since its microscopic structure at the liquid state it is not known yet and many different models are available. The choice of the water model is determined by
            <ul>
              <li>The size of the system.</li>
              <li>The simulation period.</li>
              <li>The physical properties that have to be simulated with the most accuracy.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            The most suitable model for our system was the $TIP3P$, This water model is widely used because it is not too computationally demanding. Even to simulate a simple protein in water, a large number of water molecule is required, and their positions and velocity have to be updated at every time step. It is then necessary to have a quite simple water model. More complex models are available, but it is possible to employ them only on small systems, with less than $1000$ water molecules, and for short simulation periods $(\simeq1ps)$. These are not the length and time scales of biophysical systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            This model, as many other frequently used, ignores the proton hopping from one molecule to another, which favours the cluster formation. It describes the water as a planar molecule, with three interaction sites, an Oxygen atom and two Hydrogens. The atoms interact due to the Coulomb interaction and are modeled as point like particles. The long range electrostatic interaction is truncated after a cutoff distance. The Oxygen atom also interacts with other molecules by means of the Lennard-Jones interaction.
